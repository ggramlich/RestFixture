!3 LET alternative with Slim symbols

Instead of the LET functionality of !-RestFixture-!, we rely on the standard Slim symbol mechanisms.
The !-RestScriptFixture-! provides the ''header'', ''js'' and ''body'' methods instead.

''Extract values from header, using regular expressions''

-!|script|
|setBody|<resource><name>Bill</name><data>Some data on Bill</data></resource>|
|POST   |/resources/     |has status     |201     |has body     |no-body     |
|$id=   |header          |Location:/resources/(.+)                           |

The regex is applied to each header. On the first match the first group is extracted and
assigned as value to the symbol ''id''.

Labels are global and can be shared across rest fixture instances.

''Extract values from XML body via XPath''
''Symbols are global and re-usable across all Slim Fixtures'' 

Here follows a usage of the previously extracted ''id''.
This example also shows how to extract data from the XML body of a response using XPath.

-!|script|
|GET|/resources/$id|has status|200|has body|!-
 /resource/name[text()='Bill']<br/>
 /resource/data[text()='Some data on Bill']
-! |
|$name=|body|/resource/name/text()|

...or from a JSON body

-!|script|
|GET|/resources/1.json|has status|200|has header|Content-Type : application/json|has body|!-
 /resource/name[text()='a funky name']<br/>
 /resource/data[text()='an important message']
 -! |
|$name=|body|/resource/name/text()|


As an alternative to !-LetTestActionFixture-! we can get/set constant values for Slim symbols with the echo method from the !-fitnesse.fixtures.EchoFixture-! that is defined as a library in SuiteSetUp.

!|script                  |
|$resType=|echo|/resources|

!*** Note
Look at the source code of this page to see that the resource URI
for the GET method below is defined as '''$resType/$id'''
***!

-!|script|
|GET      |$resType/$id|has status   |200    |
|$symName=|body        |/resource/name/text()|
|check    |echo        |$symName     |Bill   |
