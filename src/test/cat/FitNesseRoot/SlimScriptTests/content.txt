!1 Rest Fixture Acceptance Test Suite - SLIM Script Table version

The !-RestFixture-! supports SLIM as test runner. In addition to using it as a !-TableTable-!, there is a derived version !-RestScriptFixture-!
which you can also use as a !-ScriptTable-! and thus you can scenarios with !-ScenarioTables-!.

Instead of using the !-RestFixture's-! own variable handling, you are encoured to use Slim's symbol mechanism.

The included tests are mainly translations of the SlimTests, using lots of scenarios to make the test suite resemble the SlimTests suite.
But actually the !-RestScriptFixture-! is supposed to be used to build your own domain specific language with scenarios.
